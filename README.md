Tuberculosis is one of the most deadly lung disease in the world, and mainly found in developing countries. It is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. In developed countries, many radiological expertise still inaccurately assessing the X-ray images, missing out patients who were actually affected by the bacteria, and it also took a long time to manually assess them.

While treatment is possible for its patients, quick diagnosis using the X-Ray images for each patient would be beneficial for both patient and doctors in terms of time. Creating a classifier model which could predict various conditions from each X-Ray images.

The aim of this project is creating a reliable classifier neural network which can classify a person's lung condition through its X-Ray scan.

This project's output is a model which classify a patient's lung condition, which is a binary classifier, using the image of an x-ray scan.
